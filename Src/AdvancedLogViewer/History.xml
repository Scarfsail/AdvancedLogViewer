<History>
  <Version version="10.0.1" date="2022-12-22">
    <Feature>Application updated from .NET 5 to .NET 7. Besides all the good what .NET 7 brings, there is an issue with trimming (reducing final size of the app) of winform applications. This caused increase in the both installer and installed app.</Feature>
  </Version>
  <Version version="9.1.1" date="2021-01-28">
    <Fix>Application icon disappered since version 9.0.2. Thanks martin-lacina-swi for fixing this bug in #27.</Fix>
    <Fix>Clicking on url links inside the app raised unhandled exception since 9.0.2. Thanks 7rakir for fixing this bug in #26.</Fix>
  </Version>
  <Version version="9.1.0" date="2021-01-23">
    <Feature>Feature request #24: Added support for tabs beside spaces in custom patterns. It's a new keyword $Tabs$. Also both the existing $Spaces$ and new one $Tabs$ are shown in the help below the edit box.</Feature>    
    <Feature>Feature request #19: Ability to show / hide context menu "Browse for Logs" in Windows Explorer. Option is in Settings->System Integration</Feature>
  </Version>
  <Version version="9.0.2" date="2021-01-21">
    <BigFeature>This is the first version built in .NET 5 as self-contained application. Thus it doesn't need any .NET framework to be installed on the target machine. Because of that, the app is compiled for both x86 and x64 environments with appropriate embedded framework inside. This change increased installer size to ~20 MB but benefit of not requiring installed specific .NET framework won over the increased size of binaries. There is visible performance boost mainly on bigger logs thanks to improvements in .NET 5.</BigFeature>
    <Fix>Fixed various bugs related to enabled UAC causing crashes of ALV.</Fix>
    <Change>All setting and log files are now in Users\{CurrentUser}\AppData\Roaming\AdvancedLogViewer instead of \ProgramData\AdvancedLogViewer. This allows to run ALV even with restricted UAC without need to run app as administrator.</Change>
    <Change>Serilog is used for ALV internal logging instead of log4net. It brings slightly better performance during logging .</Change>
    <Change>Settings page is in standard WinForm instead of WPF which brings better performance and less 3rd party WPF libraries only because of that one page.</Change>
  </Version>
  <Version version="8.1.0" date="2019-01-04">
    <Feature>Extended log level parser to support various input strings instead of exact Enum's name. Goal is to support Serilog log levels like DBG, WRN, ...</Feature>
    <Feature>Log file name parts finder finds also other parts when base name doesn't contain numeric sequence (e.g. it's just FileName.log) and other parts have the sequence before .log (e.g. FileName_1.log)</Feature>
  </Version>
  <Version version="8.0.2" date="2018-08-30">

    <Fix>Support of UTF8 documents.</Fix>

    <Fix>Fixed issue with progressive loading - log was always loaded without progressive loading -> log was shown at once which caused long loading times for big logs.</Fix>
    <Fix>Fixed few minor issues and typos during code refactoring</Fix>
    <Feature>Project switched from .NET 3.5 to .NET 4.0. Advanced Log Viewer requires .NET 4.0 to be installed on the machine. </Feature>
